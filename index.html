                    <p class="desc">The Sandwich Bank is the collection that ties The Bread Bank and The Ingredients Bank together by adding the possibility to make sandwiches out of a loaf of bread and ingredients owned. Each loaf will be able to create a maximum of 8 slices of bread before being burnt.
                        When an owner of a loaf wants to make a sandwich they will need to slice their bread on our website and they will receive 2 slices of bread as well as a visibly sliced loaf, both in the form of NFTs. With the 2 slices, also on the site, a sandwich can be made with the addition of ingredients, this sandwich will also be an NFT. Every loaf of bread can be sliced a maximum of 4 times yielding 8 slices of bread. After the loaf gets cut the final time the original TBB NFT will get burnt.</p>
