              <p>The Bread Bank is the first collection we are going to release 
                and it will consist of 10000 unique loaves of bread that act 
                as a pass for our play-to-earn game. They will have a mint 
                price of 0.03 ETH. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The Bread Bank NFTs are more than just cute pieces of art,
                 they give utility to an otherwise normal NFT by giving holders 
                 the ability to do a multitude of things with their loaf. 
                 For example, on top of playing the game to obtain items 
                 which can later be sold as NFTs they also give the user 
                 the possibility to interact with the other 2 collections 
                 by making and trading sandwiches.

            <div class="description">
              <p>The ingredients Bank will consist of an unlimited amount of 
                sandwich ingredients that will be given to active players of 
                the game. These ingredients can also be resold on the secondary 
                market as some very rare pieces will be given to the most 
                active players.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ingredients can also be used to make unique sandwiches 
                with rarer ingredients making rarer and more desirable 
                sandwiches. As well as that, in order to obtain more exclusive 
                ingredients, you can merge 2 identical items to obtain an 
                item that is one step higher in terms of rarity.

                THE SANDWICH BANK

            </div>
            <div class="description">
              <p>The Sandwich Bank is the collection that ties The Bread Bank 
                and The Ingredients Bank together by adding the possibility 
                to make sandwiches out of a loaf of bread and ingredients owned. 
                Each loaf will be able to create a maximum of 8 slices of bread 
                before being burnt.
              </p>
              <p>
                When an owner of a loaf wants to make a sandwich they will need 
                to slice their bread on our website and they will receive 2 
                slices of bread as well as a visibly sliced loaf, both in the 
                form of NFTs. With the 2 slices, also on the site, a sandwich 
                can be made with the addition of ingredients, this sandwich 
                will also be an NFT. Every loaf of bread can be sliced a maximum
                 of 4 times yielding 8 slices of bread. After the loaf gets 
                 cut the final time the original TBB NFT will get burnt.
